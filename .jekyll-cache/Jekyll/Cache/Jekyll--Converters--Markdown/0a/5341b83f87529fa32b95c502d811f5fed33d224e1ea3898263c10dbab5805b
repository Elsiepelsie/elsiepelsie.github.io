I"Ñ<p><em>A blogfolio?!</em></p>

<p>Welcome to Elsiepelsie, some type of blogfolio. (A blog &amp; portfolio!)</p>

<p>In my blog I will write about some everyday projects that require minimal effort to research. This will include recipes, things you can get for free or cheap, reviews ranging from songs to pens and much more.</p>

<p>My portfolio will have projects that take longer to finalize.I will attempt to answer interesting questions or specific topics.</p>
