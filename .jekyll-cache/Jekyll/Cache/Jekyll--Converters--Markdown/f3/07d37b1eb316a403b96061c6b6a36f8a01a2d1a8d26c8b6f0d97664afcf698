I"€<p><i> A brief introduction </i></p>

<p>Consider this blog like an antique shop. My posts will not be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will range from cooking to writing and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio will include projects that Iâ€™m working on. Anything that doesnâ€™t fit in this category will be found in blog entries. My blog entries will mainly relate to my day-to-day life.</p>

<p>You will find my blog entries on the main page, projects of all kinds in my portfolio.</p>
