I"è<p><em>A blogfolio?!</em></p>

<p>Welcome to Elsiepelsie!</p>

<p>This blogfolio will have various purposes.</p>

<p>This means that my posts won‚Äôt be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics or questions will include cooking, reading, games and much more.</p>

<p>My portfolio will be filled with specific topic-oriented projects that I‚Äôm working on or have finished. Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.</p>

<p>The development of this website followed a brief existential crisis.</p>
