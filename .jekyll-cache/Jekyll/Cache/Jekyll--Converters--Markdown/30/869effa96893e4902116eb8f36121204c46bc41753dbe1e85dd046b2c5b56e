I"Ô<p><em>Why I decided to start building a website</em></p>

<p>A few days ago, I was nervously looking at my computer. My professor had mailed us the good news that we would know our grades by the end of the day. The assignment that I had worked on so hard would finally be revealed</p>

<p>After repeatedly refreshing ladok the mark appeared. My heart sank a little, but I hoped that frantically refreshing my screen would change my result. The letter didnâ€™t change, of course. It remained a big fat U.</p>

<p>Within a moment I was in bed, curled in a foetal position. The first thing I did was call my boyfriend. He came over immediately. We did some brainstorming together. These were the results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Living in a conversion van</li>
  <li>Renovating a â‚¬1 house in Italy</li>
  <li>Actually opening a sheep farm in Ireland</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course that wouldnâ€™t help to improve my current state of mind. Instead I looked for an alternative to my studies. Something that would enable me a â€˜work to liveâ€™ balance. As opposed to the dusty career that my studies promised me.</p>

<p>Around that time my boyfriend was very much engaged with his own project. He was designing a <a href="https://mr-volta.github.io/">website</a> for a friend. I had already tried to understand HTML a few times, but my motivation lacked. Starting from scratch wasnâ€™t something that I wanted to start with. But somehow I manged to get inspired this time.</p>

<p>Thanks to my boyfriend I discovered a <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">website</a> offering themes that I could start out with. This gave me the chance to learn while working within an existing framework.</p>

<p>I opted for the clean and simple <a href="https://github.com/lamccloskey/jekyll-theme-blogfolio">Blogfolio</a>. It fit me requirments for what I wanted to work with.</p>
