I"‹<p><em>The author &amp; the blogfolio</em></p>

<p>Welcome.</p>

<p>(â€¦)</p>

<p>This blogfolio has various purposes.</p>

<p>In other words, my posts arenâ€™t focused on one particular topic or thought. But I attempted to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio is filled with projects that Iâ€™m working on or have finished. Anything that doesnâ€™t fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.</p>

<p>This idea followed a brief existential crisis.</p>
