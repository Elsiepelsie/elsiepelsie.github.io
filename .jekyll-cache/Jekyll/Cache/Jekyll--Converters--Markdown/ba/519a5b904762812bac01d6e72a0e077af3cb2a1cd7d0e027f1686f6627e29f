I"˜<p><em>A blogfolio?!</em></p>

<p>Welcome to Elsiepelsie!</p>

<p>This blogfolio will have various purposes.</p>

<p>This means that my posts wonâ€™t be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio will be filled with projects that Iâ€™m working on or have finished. Anything that doesnâ€™t fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.</p>

<p>This idea followed a brief existential crisis.</p>
