I"<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe it’s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a thin, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as active, very clumsy and sassy. He would run through our garden to our kitchen window before he would struggle to climp 1,5 meter.</p>

<p>He kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. Now that he’s gone,  I can’t shake the feeling of constantly being watched. Unless someone is with me everywhere I go a formless blob of human is staring at me. Waiting for me to slip up to hurt me.</p>
