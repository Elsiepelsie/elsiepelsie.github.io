I"˜<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation calls for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat, I used to think he kept our family together. Come to think of it, he rather kept my psychological shenanigans in check. Now that he passed</p>
