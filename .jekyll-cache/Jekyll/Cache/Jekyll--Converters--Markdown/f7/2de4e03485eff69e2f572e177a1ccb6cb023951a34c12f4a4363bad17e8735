I"¦<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat, I used to think he kept our family together. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was thin, miserable</p>

<p>Come to think of it, he rather kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. Now that heâ€™s gone I canâ€™t shake the feeling of constantly being watched. Unless someone is with me everywhere I go a formless blob of human is staring at me. Waiting for me to slip up to hurt me.</p>
