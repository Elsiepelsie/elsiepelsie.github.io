I"Ú<p><em>A brief introduction</em></p>

<p>Consider this blog like an antique shop. My posts will not be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will include cooking, reading, photography projects and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio will include projects that I‚Äôm working on (listed above). Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit in this category will be found in blog entries. My blog entries will mainly relate to my day-to-day life.</p>

<p>You will find my blog entries on the main page. My projects can be found by clicking on ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù at the top right of the main page.</p>
