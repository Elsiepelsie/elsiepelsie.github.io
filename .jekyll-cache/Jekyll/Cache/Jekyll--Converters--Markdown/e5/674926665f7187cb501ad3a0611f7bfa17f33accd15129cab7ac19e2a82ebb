I"ê<p><em>A brief introduction</em></p>

<p>Consider this blog like an thrift store that is of various purposes</p>

<p>My posts will not be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio will include projects that I‚Äôm working on (some are listed above). Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those will mainly relate to my day-to-day life.</p>

<p><em>Organization</em></p>

<p>Under construction‚Ä¶</p>
