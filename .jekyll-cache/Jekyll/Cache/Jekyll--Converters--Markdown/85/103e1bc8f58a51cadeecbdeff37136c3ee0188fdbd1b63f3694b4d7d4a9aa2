I"¸<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a thin, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as sweet, very clumsy and sassy.</p>

<p>I was obsessed with him. I bought cat training books, secretly gave him milk, even put on pet relaxation music. I became an obsessed cat lady at the age of 13 years. This fact led me to my first relationship and later a long-standing infatuation.</p>

<p>He kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. Now that heâ€™s gone,  I canâ€™t shake the feeling of constantly being watched. Unless someone is with me everywhere I go a formless blob of human is staring at me. Waiting for me to slip up to hurt me.</p>
