I"4<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe it’s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a thin, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as sweet, very clumsy and sassy.</p>

<p>I was obsessed with him. I bought cat training books, secretly gave him milk, even put on pet relaxation music. I became an obsessed cat lady at the age of thirteen. This fact led me to my first relationship and later a long-standing infatuation. After a few years he would become more of a friend. He would sit next to me when I locked myself out of the house or sit in my room while I was doing my homework. When I was sick he become my own purring watterbottle. In the past year, I discovered the importance of family. This made me consider him as even more important to me. He had become a bit of a family member.</p>

<p>He also kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. I wouldn’t be as scared to be home alone. The people in my garden were almost transparent. I would even dare to go for a midnight snack every now and then. Now that he’s gone, everything has come back. Most noticeably in</p>

<p>I can’t shake the feeling of constantly being watched. Unless someone is with me everywhere I go a formless blob of human is staring at me. Waiting for me to slip up to hurt me.</p>
