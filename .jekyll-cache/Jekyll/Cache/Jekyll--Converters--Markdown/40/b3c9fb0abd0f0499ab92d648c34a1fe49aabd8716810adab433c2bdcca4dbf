I"<p><em>How a brief existential crisis led me to building a website</em></p>

<p>Sweaty palms, a light headache, a faint feeling of hope. Those were all I experienced only a few days ago. I was waiting for my assignment marking. The result of my assignment, that I had overworked and overstressed on finalizing every little detail, would finally be revealed. After repeatedly refreshing ladok - a swedish website for checking results - the mark appeared. For a short moment my headache increased and I started frantically clicking on my screen to refresh. But the letter didn’t change, it remained a big fat U.</p>

<p>I had failed. And my heart sank.</p>

<p>Within a moment I had become a little heap of blankets, curled in a foetal position covered with blankets. The first thing I did was calling my boyfriend while(fake) crying. He came over immediately.</p>

<p>Now, he and I are different in various ways. (…)</p>

<p>So after having brainstormed for a while, I did two things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I looked up how much it cost to renovate a €1 house in Italy</li>
  <li>(…)</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course that wouldn’t help to improve current state of mind. Instead I looked for an alternative to what I’m still currently studying. Something that would enable me a ‘work to live’ balance.</p>
