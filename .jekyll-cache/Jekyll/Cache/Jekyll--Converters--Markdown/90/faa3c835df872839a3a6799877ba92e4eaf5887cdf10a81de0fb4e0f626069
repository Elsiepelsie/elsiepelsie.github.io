I"<p><em>Why I decided to start building a website</em></p>

<p>Sweaty palms, a light headache, a faint feeling of hope. I experienced y a few days ago. I was waiting for my assignment marking. The result of my assignment, that I had overworked and overstressed on finalizing every little detail, would finally be revealed.</p>
