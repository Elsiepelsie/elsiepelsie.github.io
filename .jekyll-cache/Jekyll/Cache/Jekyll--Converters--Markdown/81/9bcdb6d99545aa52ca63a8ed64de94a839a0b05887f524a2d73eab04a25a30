I"è<p><em>How a brief existential crisis led me to building a website</em></p>

<p>Sweaty palms, a light headache, a faint feeling of hope. Those were all I experienced only a few days ago. I was waiting for my assignment marking. The result of my assignment, that I had overworked and overstressed on finalizing every little detail, would finally be revealed. After repeatedly refreshing ladok - a swedish website for checking results - the mark appeared. For a short moment my headache increased and I started frantically clicking on my screen to refresh. But the letter didn‚Äôt change, it remained a big fat U.</p>

<p>I had failed. And my heart sank.</p>

<p>Within a moment I was in bed, curled in a foetal position. The first thing I did was call my boyfriend while fake crying. He came over immediately. This led us to do some brainstorming. These were the results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Living</li>
  <li>I wanted to renovate a house in Italy
3.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course that wouldn‚Äôt help to improve current state of mind. Instead I looked for an alternative to what I‚Äôm still currently studying. Something that would enable me a ‚Äòwork to live‚Äô balance.</p>
