I"}<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe it’s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotions. But this seems like an appropriate situation to.</p>

<p>My family’s cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died.</p>

<p>Miauwke was our family cat, I used to unconsciously think he kept our family together. Come to think of it, he rather kept my anxiety at bay.</p>
