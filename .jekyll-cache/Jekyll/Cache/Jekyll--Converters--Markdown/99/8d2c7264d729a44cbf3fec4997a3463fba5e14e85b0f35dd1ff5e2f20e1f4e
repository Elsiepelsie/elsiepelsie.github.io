I"·<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a sick, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as sweet, very clumsy and sassy.</p>

<p>I was obsessed with him. I bought cat training books, secretly gave him milk, even put on pet relaxation music. I had become an obsessed cat lady at the age of thirteen. This fact led me to my first relationship and later a long-standing infatuation. After a few years he would become more of a friend. He would sit next to me when I locked myself out of the house or sit in my room while I was doing my homework. When I was sicks he would transform into my very own purring hot watterbottle. In the past year, I discovered the importance of family. This made me consider him as even more important to me. He had become a bit of a family member.</p>

<p>He also kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. I wouldnâ€™t be as scared to be home alone. The people in my garden were almost transparent. I would even dare to go for a midnight snack every now and then. The little girl had mysteriously dissappeared. Now that heâ€™s gone, everything has come back. Most noticeably in my own house but also whenever Iâ€™m alone after sunset. Walking alone on the street scares me to death. I canâ€™t get over the thoughts of finding a corpse in between the little frontyards. At my boyfriendâ€™s someone with wide bloodred eyes keeps staring at me while Iâ€™m doing the laundry or cooking. Every place perturbs me in its own way.</p>

<p>In the light of these mental issues I have felt the urgent need to leave Belgium. Currently Iâ€™m stuck in a limbo. Everything is about to change but nothing has been decided. The existential dread has sadly not passed either. This leaves me in an existential crisis, that</p>

<p>Iâ€™m seriously reconsidering who I am and what I would want to do with my life. I would love to make a career out of some</p>
