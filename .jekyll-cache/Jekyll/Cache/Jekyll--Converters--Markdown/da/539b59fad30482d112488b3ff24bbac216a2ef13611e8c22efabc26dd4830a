I"ê<p>As of recently Iâ€™ve been lightly addicted to playing piano. Playing piano is for some a way to cope, for others a challenge or to express themselves. For me it is a way to relax, to distract myself and feel somehow productive.</p>

<p>As an amateur, starting a piece is almost like mixing colours on a painting palette. In this case, I decided to start on the first movement of the moonlight sonata of Beethoven. At first, I decided to take on this piece because it seemed easy. s</p>
