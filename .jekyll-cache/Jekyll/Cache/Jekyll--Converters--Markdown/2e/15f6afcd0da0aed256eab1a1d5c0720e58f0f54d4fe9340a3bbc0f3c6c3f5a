<p>The past week or so I’ve been lightly addicted to playing piano. Playing piano is for some a way to cope, for others a challenge or to express themselves. For me it is a way to relax, to distract myself and feel somehow productive.</p>

<p>As an amateur, starting a piece is almost like mixing colours on a painting palette. You only have a few basic colours. If you want to paint a specific scenery, you’ll have to keep to some basic mixes occasionally adding a random dot of colour to accentuate some elements.</p>

<p>The basic colours are in this case the white and black keys. The white keys are the musical tones such as Do/C, Re/D, Mi/E and so forth. Whereas the black keys represent the half-step intervals, they give the sharp or flat tone.</p>

<p>In this case, I decided to start on the first movement of the moonlight sonata of Beethoven. At first, I decided to take on this piece because it seemed easy. It technically is, however remembering the different notes</p>
