Instead I was offered the chance to play the violin. Since the options where limited, I decided to start playing violin anyway. Thankfully, that worked for me as well though my passion for it was rather dimmed. Ten years later, I finally took the chance to piano lessons at the local music academy. It was hard at first because playing an instrument is a bit like learning a language. I was fluent in violin but piano was a bit like learning German to me.

In this case, I decided to start on the first movement of the moonlight sonata of Beethoven. At first, I decided to take on this piece because it seemed easy. It technically is, however remembering the different notes</p>
