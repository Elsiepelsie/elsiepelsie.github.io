I"×<p><em>How a brief existential crisis led me to building a website</em></p>

<p>Sweaty palms, a light headache, a faint feeling of hope. Those were all I experienced only a few days ago. I was waiting for my assignment marking. The result of my assignment, that I had overworked and overstressed on finalizing every little detail, would finally be revealed. After repeatedly refreshing ladok - a swedish website for checking results - the mark appeared. For a short moment my headache increased and I started frantically clicking on my screen to refresh. But the letter didnâ€™t change, it remained a big fat U.</p>

<p>I had failed. And my heart sank.</p>

<p>Within a moment I was in bed, curled in a foetal position. The first thing I did was call my boyfriend while fake crying. He came over immediately. This led us to do some brainstorming. These were the results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Living in a conversion van</li>
  <li>Renovating a â‚¬1 house in Italy</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course that wouldnâ€™t help to improve my current state of mind. Instead I looked for an alternative to my studies. Something that would enable me a â€˜work to liveâ€™ balance. As opposed to the dusty and old future that these studies promise me.</p>
