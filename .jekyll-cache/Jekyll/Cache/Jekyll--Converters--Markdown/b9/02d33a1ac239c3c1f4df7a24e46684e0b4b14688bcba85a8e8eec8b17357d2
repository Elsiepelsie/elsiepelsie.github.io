I"“<p><i> A brief introduction </i></p>

<p>Consider this blog like an antique shop. My posts will not be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything I post in a way that makes sense. Topics will range from cooking to writing and much more. I also hope to share</p>

<p>You will find my blog entries on the main page and projects of all kinds in my portfolio.</p>
