I"ç<p><em>A blogfolio?!</em></p>

<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>This blogfolio has various purposes. My posts aren‚Äôt focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU.</p>

<p>My portfolio will be filled with projects that I‚Äôm working on or have finished. Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.</p>

<p>This idea followed a brief existential crisis. This is elaborated in my next post.</p>
