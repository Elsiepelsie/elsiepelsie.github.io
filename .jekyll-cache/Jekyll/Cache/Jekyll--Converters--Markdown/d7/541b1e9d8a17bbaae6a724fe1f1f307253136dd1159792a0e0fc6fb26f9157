I"/<p><em>My cat died a few days ago</em></p>

<p>Maybe it’s a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.</p>

<p>Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the third of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a thin, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as sweet, very clumsy and sassy.</p>

<p>At first I was obsessed with him. I became an obsessed cat lady when I was only 13 years old. So much so that</p>

<p>He kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. Now that he’s gone,  I can’t shake the feeling of constantly being watched. Unless someone is with me everywhere I go a formless blob of human is staring at me. Waiting for me to slip up to hurt me.</p>
