*My cat died a few days ago*

Maybe it's a little early to dive in my deep and complex emotional state but the situation called for it.

Our cutest, sweetest and funniest cat died on the 3rd of December 2020. Miauwke was our family cat. We found him on our street, right on our porch. He was a sick, miserable and timid cat. Over the years we would get to know him as smart, very clumsy but sassy.

I was obsessed with him. I bought cat training books, secretly gave him milk, even put on pet relaxation music in case he needed to relax. I had become an obsessed cat lady at the age of thirteen. This fact led me to my first relationship and later a long-standing infatuation. After a few years he would be more like a friend. He would sit next to me when I locked myself out of the house or sit in my room while I was doing my homework. When I was sick he would transform into my own purring hot watterbottle. And In the past year, after I discovered the importance and definition of family, I considered him somewhat as a family member.

He also kept some of my psychological shenanigans in check. I wouldn't be as scared to be home alone. The people in my garden were almost transparent. I would even dare to go for a midnight snack every now and then since the little girl had mysteriously dissappeared. Now that he's gone, everything has come back. Most noticeably in my own house but also whenever I'm alone after sunset. Walking alone on the street scares me to death. I can't get over the thoughts of finding a corpse in between the little frontyards. At my boyfriend's someone with wide bloodred eyes keeps staring at me while I'm doing the laundry or cooking. Every place perturbs me in its own way.

In the light of these mental issues I have felt the urgent need to leave Belgium. Currently I'm stuck in a limbo. Everything is about to change but nothing has been decided. The existential dread has sadly not passed either. 

This leaves me in an extended existential crisis, that will only end once I know who I am and what I want to do with my life.
