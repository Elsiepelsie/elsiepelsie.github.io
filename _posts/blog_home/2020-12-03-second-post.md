*Why I decided to start building a website*

A few days ago, I was nervously looking at my computer. My professor had mailed us the good news that we would know our grades by the end of the day. I would finally know the result of my assignment that I had worked so hard for.

After repeatedly refreshing ladok, the mark appeared. My heart sank a little, but I hoped that by refreshing the website a few more times my result would change. The letter didn't change, of course. It remained a big fat U. 


Within a moment I was in bed, curled in a foetal position and contemplating my fate. The first thing I did was call my boyfriend. After he came over, we brainstormed a little. These were the results:


1. Living in a conversion van
2. Renovating a â‚¬1 house in Italy
3. Actually opening a sheep farm in Ireland

Those were all too expensive. And it wouldn't help to improve my current state of mind. 

Around that time my boyfriend was very much engaged with his own project. He was designing a [website](https://mr-volta.github.io/){:target="_blank"} for a friend. I had already tried to understand HTML a few times, but my motivation lacked. Starting from scratch wasn't something that I wanted to do either. 

But somehow it inspired me this time. 

Thanks to my boyfriend I discovered a [website](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"} offering themes that I could start out with. This gave me the chance to learn a few things while working on my own website.

I opted for the clean and simple [Blogfolio](https://github.com/lamccloskey/jekyll-theme-blogfolio){:target="_blank"}. It fit my requirments for what I wanted to work with.

By doing this, I've managed to procrastinate quite well on developping my assignment. And I plan on doing so, until I really can't ignore the [panic monster](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html){:target="_blank"} anymore.
