*A blogfolio?!*

Welcome to Elsiepelsie!

This blogfolio will have various purposes.

 This means that my posts won't be focused on one particular topic or thought. But I will attempt to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics will include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also hope to share my experience of being an online student @MAU. 

My portfolio will be filled with specific topic-oriented projects that I'm working on or have finished. Anything that doesn't fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.

The development of this website followed a brief existential crisis.
