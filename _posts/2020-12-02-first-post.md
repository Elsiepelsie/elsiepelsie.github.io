*A brief introduction*


This blogfolio has various purposes. 

In other words, my posts aren't focused on one particular topic or thought. But I attempted to organize everything in a way that makes sense. Topics include cooking, reading, music and much more. I also share my experience of being an online student @MAU. 

My portfolio is filled with projects that I'm working on or have finished. Anything that doesn't fit in this category will be found in blog entries. Those are mainly related to my everyday life.
