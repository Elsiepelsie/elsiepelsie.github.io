*Why I decided to start building a website*

A few days ago, I was nervously looking at my computer. My professor had mailed us the good news that we would know our grades by the end of the day. I would finally know the result of my assignment that I had worked so hard for.

After repeatedly refreshing ladok the mark appeared. My heart sank a little, but I hoped that by refreshing the website a few more times would change my result. The letter didn't change, of course. It remained a big fat U. 


Within a moment I was in bed, curled in a foetal position and contemplating my fate. The first thing I did was call my boyfriend. After he came over, we started to brainstorm together. These were the results:


1. Living in a conversion van
2. Renovating a â‚¬1 house in Italy
3. Actually opening a sheep farm in Ireland

Of course that wouldn't help to improve my current state of mind. Instead I looked for an alternative to my studies. Something that would enable me a 'work to live' balance. As opposed to the dusty career that my studies promised me.

Around that time my boyfriend was very much engaged with his own project. He was designing a [website](https://mr-volta.github.io/) for a friend. I had already tried to understand HTML a few times, but my motivation lacked. Starting from scratch wasn't something that I wanted to start with. But somehow I manged to get inspired this time. 

Thanks to my boyfriend I discovered a [website](http://jekyllthemes.org/) offering themes that I could start out with. This gave me the chance to learn while working within an existing framework.

I opted for the clean and simple [Blogfolio](https://github.com/lamccloskey/jekyll-theme-blogfolio). It fit me requirments for what I wanted to work with.
